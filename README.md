# TrafficSign
Traffic sign Detection and classification using SVM classifier and pre-trained AlexNet.


The work presented in this project deals with the object recognition and classification. It deals with traffic sign detection and classification. The critical job in self-driving cars is to recognize and detect the traffic signs and take particular action based on that. In this project, we have worked on detection and classification of traffic signs using two different classifiers, namely Support Vector Machines(SVM) and a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) i.e. AlexNet and fine-tuned it to meet our requirements.
